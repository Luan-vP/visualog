# Visualog

Turn python log messages into midi / audio that can be seen by Synesthesia.

## Who is it for? 

People who want to see their programs as art and explore them dynamically.

## What problem does the software solve? 

An abstract, beautiful live visualisation of my program.

## How is it going to work? 

- Log interface
- - Logging formatter that can be added to the root handler
- Audio out? 
- - Logging formatter grabs the audio channel to output
- Audio content? 
- - TODO - Some audio design needed here 
- - Error codes as frequencies etc. 
- - For now, hash + transform, or just the fastest way to turn it deterministically into audio
